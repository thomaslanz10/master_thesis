## Analysis Tools for Investigating Thunderstorm Initiation Conditions

For reaching the aim of the master thesis (see 'Master_Thesis_Lanz.pdf'), the analysis tools consists of different tools for investigating the conditions and processes of the atmosphere: terrain height maps, horizontal maps, soundings, vertical cross-section, temporal evolution of a variable at a specific location, temporal evolution of the pre-storm environment of all thunderstorms in May 2018 and in end of the century climate conditions, maps of trajectories and temporal evolution along trajectories. The figures created with these tools served as basis for the analysis of thunderstorm initiation and the answering of the research question of the master thesis.

The programming was done in IDE Jupyter Notebook (v6.0.3) with the IPython Kernel (v7.13.0) and with package and environment management by Conda. For each of the analysis tools, a notebook document was created. In the following section the workflow of the analysis tools is described.

## What the Analysis Tools Do and How to Use
For the analysis tools data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (v4 ARW) (Powers et al., 2017) and from the Lagranto program (Sprenger & Wernli, 2015) is used, which takes input data from the WRF model. The WRF data is in netCDF file format and the Lagranto output data in ASCII file format. 

The following subsections provide information regarding the useage of the codes.
